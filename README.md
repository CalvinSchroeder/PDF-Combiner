# PDF-Combiner
Simple python script to combine multiple pdf files into a single pdf file. I got annoyed with Adobe Acrobat's free version taking forever to combine the files.

You will need to download the PyPDF2 package.

Must use directory locations of computer. Example directories have been included. Change to desired directory as needed. On Windows, you can select the file and hit Ctrl+Shift+C to copy as path, which copies the entire directory for you automatically.

Follow comments in code for formatting of inputs.
